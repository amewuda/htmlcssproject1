        <h1>Design with HTML and CSS</h1>
        <article class="1">
            <p>HTML and CSS is that traditional structuring and styling of contents on the web. This helps to build anything can you imagine on the internet.</p>

        <h1>Design with ReactJs</h1>
        <article class="2">
            <p> It's the
                best time for JavaScript. The Facebook team has a strong contender known as React.js.
                React.js is just a view from Model-View-Controller. It is lightweight and renders with amazing speed. The basic encapsulated unit of
                code is called a component. These components are composed together, forming a whole UI.</p>

        <h1>Design with AngularJs</h1>
        <article class="2">
            <p>Angular exploded onto the scene because of the simple fact that it's built by Google (it is
                open source). Angular is basically like putting HTML on steroids. The applications and
                pages that you create use regular HTML that we're all used to, but they include a number of
                new and custom directives that extend the core functionality of HTML, giving it awesome
                new power. <br>
                Another great feature of Angular, which has seasoned non-web developers flocking to it is
                that it is built from the group to be heavily tested and supports dependency injection. It's a
                framework that doesn't make creating sophisticated web applications feel like traditional
                web development.</p>
